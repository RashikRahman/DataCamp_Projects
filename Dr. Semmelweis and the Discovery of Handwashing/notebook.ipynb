If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"13f090f9f0"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# importing modules\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv into yearly\nyearly = pd.read_csv('datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv')\n\n# Print out yearly\nprint(yearly)","cell_type":"code","execution_count":0},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"45ea098e15"},"deletable":false,"tags":["context"],"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true}},"source":"## 2.

The fate of Dr. Semmelweis\n<p>So handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.</p>\n<p>The tragedy is that, despite the evidence, Semmelweis' theory — that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (what we today know as <em>bacteria</em>) from autopsy room corpses — was ridiculed by contemporary scientists. The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.</p>\n<p>One reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. If he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.</p>","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"0645423069"},"tags":["sample_code"],"collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# The data Semmelweis collected points to that:\ndoctors_should_wash_their_hands = False","cell_type":"code","execution_count":0}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"nbconvert_exporter":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","name":"python","version":"3.5.2"}}}
